Android project sample structure
===============

Android Sample structure for hierarchical projects with library with very DRY gradle.

The purpose is to simplify the onboarding of new developers.



    git clone git@github.com:retospect/sampleStructure.git
    cp local.properties.sample local.properties
(fix local.properties to point to your sdk)

Then either
    ./gradlew installDebug
or 
open it in AndroidStudio.
